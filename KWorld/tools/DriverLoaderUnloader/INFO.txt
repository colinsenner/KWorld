LAST MODIFIED: May. 11, 2021


DESCRIPTION:
================

Driver Loader/Unloader tool was designed for developers to facilitate testing of their 
Windows kernel drivers and services.

The following features are supported:

- Register and unregister Windows device or kernel drivers, as well as the Windows services.

- Start and stop kernel drivers and services.

- Put operating system into the test signing mode for running unsigned drivers, as well as to 
  turn test signing off.

- All operations are supported through GUI.




INSTALLATION / UNINSTALLATION:
================================

This utility does not require installation and can be run from any location on the disk.

Pick the bitness of the executable that suits your operating system:

 - DriverLoaderUnloader64.exe for 64-bit version of Windows.

 - DriverLoaderUnloader32.exe for 32-bit version of Windows.

INFO: Using of the 32-bit version of the tool on a 64-bit operating system is allowed, but 
      may be subject to the file system redirection for the System32/Drivers folder. Thus, 
      a more convenient 64-bit version of the tool is provided.




OPERATION:
================

Make sure to run the Driver Loader/Unloader tool as administrator.

To open a driver file that you want to register/unregister, or to start/stop it, first drag 
its .sys/.dll/.exe binary file into the tool's main window. Or, click the Browse button and 
select the binary file from the file picker window. Optionally, you can go to File -> 
Open Driver/Service File to do the same, or press Ctrl+O keyboard shortcut on the keyboard.

When driver/service binary is loaded into the Driver Loader/Unloader tool you have the 
following options:

- Click Register Driver to register the driver that is currently selected in the tool.
  (Driver or service registration is required before you can start it.)
  (Registration is persistent after a reboot.)
  (This option is available via Ctrl+R keyboard shortcut.)

- Click Unregister Driver to remove previous registration for the driver that is currently 
  selected in the tool.
  (If driver or service was running previously, it will be stopped first.)
  (This option is available via Ctrl+U keyboard shortcut.)

- Start Driver to start a previously registered driver or service.
  (There will be no confirmation if the driver/service was started successfully.)
  (This option is available via Ctrl+S keyboard shortcut.)

- Stop Driver to stop previously started driver or service.
  (There will be no confirmation if the driver/service was stopped successfully.)
  (Stopping a driver/service does not unregister it. So it can be re-started again.)
  (This option is available via Ctrl+D keyboard shortcut.)

The Actions menu of the tool has the option to Register & Start Driver, that you can also 
invoke by using the Ctrl+Shift+S keyboard shortcut. Such option will combine registration 
and start of the driver/service in one action.

INFO: To view the logging output from your driver/service it is recommended to use a tool
      like DebugView:
       https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/debugview




OPTIONS:
================

By selecting Edit -> Test Signing (Kernel Drivers) you can enable or disable the test 
signing mode for running unsigned drivers. The original state of that mode will be displayed
with a checkmark in that menu option. A checkmark will indicate that the test signing is 
currently enabled. (If this option is grayed out, make sure to run the Driver Loader/Unloader 
tool as administrator.)

NOTE that changing of the test signing mode will require a reboot, and won't be indicated 
     in the tool prior to that.

SECURITY WARNING: Enabling test signing mode may jeopardize the security of the operating 
system it was enabled on. Additionally it may disrupt the boot process of your operating system. 
Thus, it is highly recommended to enable it ONLY in a test operating system, such a virtual machine!
